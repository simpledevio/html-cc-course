# HTML Crash Course

This repo contains the folders for each module in the Simple Dev HTML Crash Course.

The files in each folder show the final code for each module, not the starting code.

You can download the repo by clicking the green Code button in the corner and clicking Download ZIP.

The repo may occasionally be updated, so you may have to download a new ZIP in the future.
